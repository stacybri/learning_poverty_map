# Mapping Tool for Learning Poverty Data
This is an open source script to map the learning poverty data.  See the Learning Poverty github repo for more details on how this measure is constructed.  https://github.com/worldbank/LearningPoverty.

This is a personal project, and should not be viewed as an official World Bank project.

The data for this project is pulled from the World Bank open data API, and should be entirely reproducible.  The shape file is downloaded from open source sources as well.  Shape file was retrieved from https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries.  The original data comes from Natural Earth and is public domain. I appreciate the organizations Natural Earth, Lexman and the Open Knowledge Foundation for this data.

As a significant contributor to human capital deficits, the learning crisis undermines sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The paper introduces the new concept of _learning poverty_ and provides a synthetic indicator with global coverage to spotlight this crisis. _Learning poverty_ means being unable to read and understand a short, age-appropriate text by age 10. This indicator brings together schooling and learning by adjusting the proportion of kids in school bellow a proficiency threshold by the out-of-school population.

The new data show that **more than half of all children in World Bank client countries suffer from _learning poverty_** – the majority of them low- and middle-income countries. And progress in reducing _learning poverty_ is far too slow to meet the SDG aspirations: even if countries reduce their _learning poverty_ at the fastest rates we have seen so far in this century, the goal of ending it will not be attained by 2030.

I will try to update as new data is released.
